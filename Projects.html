        <p>
            Cybersecurity is important for people on the internet because it may help in protecting their personal information and prevent them from becoming victims of cybercrime. This can include things like identity theft, fraud, and the theft of financial information. Cybersecurity is especially important for people who use the internet for online banking or shopping, as well as those who store sensitive information on their devices. Without proper cybersecurity measures in place, individuals are at risk of having their personal information and data accessed and used by cybercriminals.
